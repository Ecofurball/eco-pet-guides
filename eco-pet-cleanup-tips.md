# Eco Pet Clean-Up Tips

Cleaning up after your pet isn’t glamorous — but it doesn’t have to be wasteful.

Every year, billions of plastic poop bags, paper towels, and wet wipes end up in landfills or waterways. By switching to reusable, compostable, or low-impact alternatives, pet owners can reduce their environmental footprint without sacrificing hygiene.

## 🐾 1. Swap Plastic Bags for Compostables

Standard poop bags can take 500+ years to break down. Switch to:

- Cornstarch-based compostable bags
- Certified biodegradable options (look for ASTM D6400)
- Or even flushable bags — if compatible with your plumbing

---

## 🧽 2. Replace Paper Towels with Washable Cloths

Instead of burning through paper towels:

- Use old towels or microfiber cloths
- Wash with eco-friendly detergent
- Designate specific cloths for paw-wiping, spills, etc.

---

## 🌱 3. Eco-Friendly Wipes

Most commercial wipes contain plastic fibers. Look for:

- Bamboo-based biodegradable wipes
- DIY wipes made with cloth + water + gentle solution

---

## 🪣 4. Outdoor Clean-Up Kits

For backyards or patios:

- Long-lasting metal scoopers instead of plastic ones
- Compost bins or dog waste composters
- Avoid double-bagging — use one eco bag and store in sealed pail
