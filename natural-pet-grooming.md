## 🐕 Why Natural Grooming Matters

- Reduces exposure to synthetic chemicals
- Minimizes water waste and plastic use
- Encourages closer observation of your pet’s health
- Aligns grooming with seasonal coat changes

---

## 🧴 Start With the Basics

- Use **natural, biodegradable shampoos** free from sulfates and parabens.
- Avoid over-washing — it strips natural oils.
- Choose grooming tools made from **bamboo**, **wood**, or **recycled plastic**.

## 🐾 Grooming by Coat Type

### Short-Haired Breeds (e.g. Beagle, Boxer)

- Weekly brushing with soft rubber tools
- Occasional dry shampoo for freshening
- Natural bristle brushes remove loose fur and promote shine

### Medium to Long-Haired Breeds (e.g. Golden Retriever, Collie)

- Detangling before and after washing
- Use a wide-tooth comb and detangler spray with aloe or chamomile
- Air-dry when possible to avoid heat damage

### Double-Coated Breeds (e.g. Husky, German Shepherd)

- Deshedding tools used gently during blowout seasons
- Never shave unless medically necessary
- Use lukewarm water and all-natural conditioner

---

## 🌦️ Grooming by Climate

- **Warm climates** → rinse more frequently without shampoo to remove sweat and dust
- **Cold climates** → focus on paw care, dry skin, and seasonal shedding
- Adjust grooming routines with coat thickness changes across seasons

---

## 🧼 Eco Grooming Tips

- Dry off with **reusable towels**, not paper towels
- Use compostable gloves for messy grooming tasks
- Store supplies in refillable containers or glass jars
